Travel Time is a Pebble watchface that displays the current time along with the current travel time to a user-set destination. The Bing Maps API is used to get the current travel time which includes current traffic conditions. Note that the Google Maps API currently does not take current traffic conditions into account for free users. The user-set destination is saved to local storage on the phone.
